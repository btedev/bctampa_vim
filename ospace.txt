[Scene Milton's cubicle. He hears bill talking and eavesdrops.]

BILL
...stapler off my desk...

Milton puts his Swingline stapler somewhere else. The guys laugh.

BILL
...anyway, sounds great, Bob. I'll see you in a few. (they walk off) 

Hey, Milton, what's happening?

MILTON
Uh...sir...

BILL
Uh, I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could get it to go as far back against that wall as possible, that would be great.

MILTON
No, no, because I was, I was -

BILL
That way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put in here.

MILTON
No...sir...

BILL
Uh (sees the Swingline) Oh there it is.

MILTON
No. No.

BILL
Let me just get that from ya. (picks it up) Great. So if you could get to that as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Have a nice lunch, Milton. Bye.

He walks off.

MILTON
Ok. I'll set the building on fire.
